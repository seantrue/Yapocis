demo_rpc: Added DOG tests
gaussian.py: Interface for by scale index, added get* functions, change to 2-d convolution instead of shuffling column/row order with Shaper, stronger tests,
added zcsdog to use _res functions to go 20% faster.
gradient: added _res functions
median: appear to have added a memory leak in median3x3, make tests smaller (faster)
interfacecl_parser: produces slightly better error messages
interfaces: added xy for address testing, convolvesep  to support gaussian changes, operators functions to support _res style operations, zcs for zero crossings
kernels: separated buffer handling into buffers, refactored Kernel to use handle_operation pattern, added simple run-time test
buffers: added to support kernels
utils: added attempted import of view from preview (as site-specific image viewer), alignImage to make sure images have even rows/columns
